    "## 2. Development Methodology Justification** *(Short report)*\n",
    "- Methodology: CRISP-DM\n",
    "- Justification: The CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework is the \"gold standard\" for structuring data projects and particularly effective for guiding a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).\n",
    "- Key Milestones and roles:\n",
    "  - *Business Understanding:* Before looking at the data, you must define what you are trying to find.\n",
    "      - Define Objectives: What business question are you answering? (e.g., \"Why are sales dropping in the Midwest?\")\n",
    "      - Assess Situation: What resources do you have? Are there specific constraints?\n",
    "      - Identify Success Criteria: What does a \"successful\" EDA look like? (e.g., Identifying the top 3 drivers of customer churn).\n",
    "  - *Data Understanding:* Core of the EDA process.\n",
    "      - Initial Data Collection: Load dataset (CSV).\n",
    "      - Describe Data: Check the shape (rows/columns) and data types (numeric vs. categorical).\n",
    "      - Univariate Analysis: Look at distributions (histograms, box plots).\n",
    "      - Bivariate Analysis: Look for relationships/correlations (scatter plots, heatmaps).\n",
    "      - Verify Quality: Identify missing values, duplicates, and outliers.\n",
    "  - *Data Preparation (Data Wrangling):* Prepares the data for deeper analysis or modeling.\n",
    "      - Clean Data: Handle missing values (impute or drop) and fix typos or formatting issues.\n",
    "      - Select Data: Filter out irrelevant columns or rows that don't serve the business objective.\n",
    "      - Feature Engineering: Create new variables (e.g., converting a \"Birthdate\" column into an \"Age\" column).\n",
    "      - Format Data: Ensure all data types are correct (e.g., ensuring dates are datetime objects).\n",
    "  - *Modeling:* Since EDA, this might be minimal, but use simple models to find patterns.\n",
    "      - Select Techniques: Use clustering (K-Means) to find natural groupings or simple Linear Regression to see trends\n",
    "      - Generate Test Design: If you plan to build a predictive model later, this is where you split your data into \"Train\" and \"Test\" sets.\n",
    "  - *Evaluation:* Step back and look at your findings.\n",
    "      - Evaluate Results: Did your EDA actually answer the questions from Phase 1?\n",
    "      - Review Process: Did you miss any data quality issues?\n",
    "      - Determine Next Steps: Is the data \"clean\" and \"insightful\" enough to build a machine learning model, or do you need to go back to Phase 1? \n",
    "## 3. UML Diagrams** *(PDF or PNG format)*\n",
    "- **Use Case Diagram:** Show user interactions with the system.\n",
    "- **Class Diagram:** Define key data objects and their attributes.\n",
    "  - *Example:* A Use Case Diagram illustrating how analysts retrieve and filter sales data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)** *(PDF or PNG format)*\n",
    "- **DFD Level 0:** High-level overview of data movement.\n",
    "- **DFD Level 1:** Detailed breakdown of data flow between components.\n",
    "  - *Example:* A DFD showing how transaction data moves from a SQL database to a Power BI dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Security and Storage Plan** *(Short report)*\n",
    "- Describe how data will be stored (local, cloud, or hybrid).\n",
    "- Identify security risks and planned safeguards (e.g., encryption, API security).\n",
    "  - *Example:* A report explaining how sensitive customer data will be encrypted and backed up.\n"
