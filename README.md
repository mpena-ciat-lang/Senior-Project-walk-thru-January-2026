# Senior-Project-walk-thru-January-2026

### Why did we build this?
We built this system to transform millions of rows of raw government employment data into a clear, visual map of California's economic history. 
And to serve as a sample walk thru that I hope can help in your own future work.

### The Core Objective
The goal of this simulated senior project: **to identify which communities are resilient and which are vulnerable in California based on unemployment rates.** By automating the data audit and trend analysis, we moved from "guessing" about the economy to "seeing" it through:
1. **Consistency:** Ensuring every city and county is measured on a level playing field.
2. **Predictive Insight:** Moving beyond what happened in the past to identify underlying long-term trends.
3. **Accessibility:** Using Tableau to ensure a policy-maker doesn't need to know Python to understand the data.

### Final Takeaway
This project demonstrates that by using a structured framework (CRISP-DM), we can take a messy, real-world dataset and turn it into a reliable tool for economic forecasting and regional comparison.
I tried to stay true to the 5 week senior project and compile it into one single project that again, I hope, can serve as a walk-thru on what you can do using your own project to showcase to prospective employers.
